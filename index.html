        <h2> ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ what is VOCALOID? </h2>
        <p>vocaloid is a software program and kind of like a digital instrument!
            it works by plugging in the notes that you'd like the voice to sing, and assigning
            syllables to them. the end result is a computerized singing voice! vocaloid is one such program, and as the originator, is often
            used to refer to the whole vocal synthesizer community.
            however, there are many vocal synthesizer softwares to accomplish similar things,
            including synthesizer v and utau!<br>
        what is super cool and beautiful about vocal synths is that anyone can buy or download a voicebank and start making songs!
though originally specialized for japanese, there are now voicebanks in many many languages! additionally,
you can edit or "tune" the voicebank in a pretty much infinite combination of ways. 
this means that any two people, even using the same voicebank, can each create a totally unique sound.
the result is an incredibly diverse community of creatives, making every type of music under the sun,
all united by the love of the same characters!

        <h2> ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ô™ who is KAITO?</h2>
        <p>KAITO is the first male japanese vocaloid, originally released on february 17th 2006.
            since then he has been updated twice, to have a total of 6 voicebanks!
            his voice provider is naoto fuuga, an amazing singer and voice actor.
