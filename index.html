        <h2> ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ what is VOCALOID? </h2>
        <p>vocaloid is a software program and kind of like a digital instrument!
            it works by plugging in the notes that you'd like the voice to sing, and assigning
            syllables to them. the end result is a computerized singing voice! each voice gets
            assigned a character design to match their vocals, which means that there's an
            expansive cast of varied characters! </p>
            <p> vocaloid is one such program, and as the 
            originator, is often
            used to refer to the whole vocal synthesizer community.
            however, there are many vocal synthesizer softwares to accomplish similar things,
            including synthesizer v and utau!</p>
            <p>
        what is super cool and beautiful about vocal synths is that anyone can buy or download one and start making songs!
though originally popularized in japanese, there are now voicebanks in many many languages! additionally,
you can edit or "tune" the vocal in a pretty much infinite combination of ways. 
this means that any two people, even using the same voicebank, can each create a totally unique sound.
the result is an incredibly diverse community of creatives, making every type of music under the sun,
all united by the love of the same characters!
</p>

        <h2> ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ô™ who is KAITO?</h2>
        <p>KAITO is the first male japanese vocaloid, originally released on february 17th 2006.
            since then he has been updated twice, to have a total of 6 voicebanks! </p>

            </iframe></center>
        <p> since KAITO is one of the first vocaloids, he is part of the "main 6" known as cryptonloids.
         they're called that because of the company in charge of them, crypton future media. the cryptonloids 
         are the ones who most often appear in concerts, video games, collabs and merchandise! </p>

         <h3> his voice provider</h3>
         <p> KAITO'S voice provider (the person who sang the original syllables that make up his voice) is 
            naoto fuuga. he is an amazing singer and voice actor who is now 63 years old.
            he refers to KAITO as his son and collects KAITO merchandise, which I find so endearing!!! his
            posts are usually focused on KAITO and his cats and he spreads such joy and whimsy to his 
            followers. not to mention his beautiful voice breathed such life into KAITO! it's all thanks to him
            that KAITO has the gentle and sweet voice that I love so dearly!! when tuned a certain way,
            KAITO actually sounds just like naoto fuuga which i think is so amazing!! ü•πüíô
