        <h2> 𝄞₊˚⊹ what is VOCALOID? <img src="img/Kaito_chibi.png" width="2%"> </h2>
        <p>vocaloid is a software program and kind of like a digital instrument!
            it works by plugging in the notes that you'd like the voice to sing, and assigning
            syllables to them. the end result is a computerized singing voice! each voice gets
            assigned a character design to match their vocals, which means that there's an
            expansive cast of varied characters! </p>
            <p> vocaloid is one such program, and as the 
            originator, is often
            used to refer to the whole vocal synthesizer community.
            however, there are many vocal synthesizer softwares to accomplish similar things,
            including synthesizer v and utau!</p>
            <p>
        what is super cool and beautiful about vocal synths is that anyone can buy or download one and start making songs!
though originally popularized in japanese, there are now voicebanks in many many languages! additionally,
you can edit or "tune" the vocal in a pretty much infinite combination of ways. 
this means that any two people, even using the same voicebank, can each create a totally unique sound.
the result is an incredibly diverse community of creatives, making every type of music under the sun,
all united by the love of the same characters!

            width="2%"> </h2>
        <p>KAITO is the first male japanese vocaloid, originally released on february 17th 2006.
            since then he has been updated twice, to have a total of 6 voicebanks! </p>
        <p> since KAITO is one of the first vocaloids, he is part of the "main 6" known as cryptonloids.
         they're called that after their distributor company, <em>crypton</em> future media. the cryptonloids 
         are the ones who most often appear in concerts, video games, collabs and merchandise! </p>

         <h3> 「♥︎」ﾟ+.ヽ(≧▽≦)ﾉ his voice provider</h3>
         <p> voice providers sing the original syllables that make up a voicebank. for KAITO, that is 
            naoto fuuga! mr. fuuga is an amazing singer and voice actor who is now 63 years old.
            he refers to KAITO as his son and collects KAITO merchandise, which I find so endearing!!! his
            posts are usually focused on KAITO and his cats and he spreads such joy and whimsy to his 
            followers. not to mention his beautiful voice breathed such life into KAITO! it's all thanks to him
            that KAITO has the gentle and sweet voice that I love so dearly!! when tuned a certain way,
            KAITO actually sounds just like mr. fuuga which i think is so amazing!! 🥹💙

            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V1</strong></em> - his original release, 19 years ago! i would describe this as his "harshest" voice,
                but even so, it has so much charm and he sounds so sweet!! his voice just fills me with joy, it's so pretty and warm
                i don't even know how to describe it!!!!!!!!
            </li>
            <li> 
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 STRAIGHT</strong></em> - 7 years after his V1, his V3 update was released, containing 4 voicebanks!
                V3 STRAIGHT was meant to sound most similar to his V1, and has a smooth, clear sound. this is his most popular
                voicebank! its so delicious and wonderful I LOVE KAITO 😭💙
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 WHISPER</strong></em> - MY FAVORITE VOICEBANK MY FAVORITE COLLECTION OF SOUNDS TO EVER 
                EXIST ON THIS EARTH WOWOWOWOW SO SOFT AND GENTLE AND PRETTY!?!?!?!?!?!??! OMGG SO TENDER SO PRECIOUS SO SWEET

                CRISP IN COMPARISON??? delicious DELICIOUS AUARGHRGRH genuinely this voicebank is such a big part of
                why i love KAITO so hard, i will always remember the first time i heard it MY BRAIN IMMEDIATELY FELL OUT OF MY

            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 SOFT</strong></em> - a beautiful inbetween of his STRAIGHT and WHISPER voicebanks!! for when 
                a producer may not want the full on gentleness of WHISPER, but also not the full strength of STRAIGHT. i think it's so amazing
                that a whopping <em>half</em> of the voicebanks in this update are just varying degrees of gentleness!!!!
                he is literally such a silly guy with the sweetest voice ever AGHAHRAAGHAHGARARAGGARRARAAA AAAAAAAA AAAA😭💙
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 ENGLISH</em></strong> - THAT'S RIGHTTT he can sing in ENGLISH HEHEHE (˶˃ ᵕ ˂˶) i love his english voice 
                so much its genuinely sooo adorable and charming and silly and wonderful and amazing. PPL MAKE FUN OF HIS ENGLISH A LOOOOT
                a very common insult is that he sounds like KERMIT.
                <center><img src="img/FLABBERGASTED.png" width="10%"><img src="img/AAA-NO.png" width="10%"></center>
                PLS guys leave him ALONE he literally just has an accent ｡°(°.◜ᯅ◝°)°｡ and <em>i</em> think he sounds utterly lovely!!!!
                words CANNOT describe the joy i get from his english OMG DUDE 😭💙
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO SP</strong></em> - this is his most recent update, released in 2024! SP stands for SUPER PACK,
                which is a set of the 6 cryptonloids. this is the voicebank used in the super popular mobile game featuring the
                cryptonloids, hatsune miku: colorful stage (more commonly known as project sekai)! 
                despite being the most recently released, this is his most robotically-raspy voice of all!! it has a super crunchy 
                sound as well as updated settings for more customization!! 💙
                a lot of people dislike that the SP moved away from the smooth, realistic direction, but personally i looove the
                more robotic-growly-ness! i find it so charming and cute when vocal synths really lean into their digitalness and have a more
                more stylized sound!! 💙

        <h3> ₊˚⊹♡ video game appearances !!</h3>
        <p> due to the success of hatsune miku, the cryptonloids have been included in many, many games!! 
            they are mostly rhythm games based on vocaloid songs!! they are so cute and colorful with really
            wonderful visuals!! these games are filled with silly choreo for the songs and outfits for
            the cryptonloids OH MY GOD I LOVE VOCALOID SO MUCH they're so silly you guys. anyway the
            the biggest games have been <strong> project mirai, </strong> in which the little meow meows are

        <p>and <strong> hatsune miku: colorful stage </strong> also known as <strong> project sekai! </strong>
        this is a mobile game with a gacha system and units of many different original characters. the art and
    storytelling is super beautiful, all the characters are deeply complex and meaningfully written!!!!
    i deeply adore the game for this, ESPECIALLY for how they represent queer characters like mizuki
akiyama!!! she's canonically transfem and her arc follows her accepting her true self and coming out to her friends!!!
her story was so delicately and sincerely told i sobbed like the whole time. GIRL
this game is sincerely so beautiful it has brought me to tears AND brought me so much joy AND the rhythm game is so 
fun, i highly recommend. ALSO IT HAS LIKE 6 DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF KAITO!!??!??! THEY'RE ALL SO BEAUTIFUL

        <p> i found KAITO when I was in middle school, which is of course a highly tumultuous time for everybody ever. 
            on top of that, we had the pandemic and everything. i was going a bit insane!!!! my marbles were lost!!! /srs <br>
            yet amidst all of that, this sparkly blue haired robot man with a funny little voice cheered me up!! he was so so 
            indescribably comforting to me when i needed it most. that's really why he's so special to me to this day!! his
            voice just has such a wondrous, powerful ability to make me smile!! the lyrics people write for him tend to be so 
            touching and reassuring!!! the sight of him just makes me light up!!!! </p>

            <p> like every vocal synth, he is a vessel and a blank canvas for the stories and emotions that anyone would like to express through him.
            he contains infinite possibilities and has inspired so much creativity in so many people, myself included!! i'm just

            青く澄んだ雨の病	<br>
Disease of a clear-blue rain. <br>
一人きりの呼吸は徒然	<br>
All alone, I breathe leisurely.<br>
痛む心に滲む鋼鉄の愛があった	<br>
Within my sore heart was this steel love spreading.<br>

触れたならば消えてしまう	<br>
“Just like a dimly burning flame<br>
微かに灯る炎のように	<br>
That would die out when touched,<br>
全てを知らないままでいたいと君は言う	<br>
I wish to be ignorant of everything,” you say.<br>

透けた白い首筋に	<br>
Onto your white, almost-transparent neck,<br>
控えめに下がるGarnet	<br>
A drop of garnet falls down modestly.<br>
閉じた目蓋に艶めくアイシャドウ	<br>
Upon your closed eyelids, the eye shadow glitters.<br>
羽のようにふわりと舞う体が	<br>
Your body, fluttering like a feather, <br>
時に震えて凍えて	<br>
Trembles and shivers at times, <br>
溢れた涙は冷たい	<br>
And the tears you spilled are so cold.<br>

甘い想いと憂いの恋は	<br>
That sweet feeling and sorrowful love<br>
幻のようで	<br>
Were like illusions—<br>
「どこにも行かないで」	<br>
“Please don’t go anywhere.”<br>
なんて言葉すり抜けてく	<br>
Words like that are slipping through me.<br>
身勝手な夢	<br>
What a selfish dream!<br>
歪んだ瞳の奥見せた赤い光が	<br>
The red light you showed me, which resided in your distorted eyes,<br>
記憶の深くに巣食って	<br>
Haunted me deep within my memory,<br>
煌めいては僕を突き放す	<br>
And when it glitters, I feel forsaken.<br>

挽歌の海沈んだなら	<br>
If we sank into the sea of elegy,<br>
静寂の悲愴を愛せただろう	<br>
We could love the grief of silence—<br>
そんな話ばかりを僕らは好んでた	<br>
We’ve always liked that kind of talk.<br>

夜空の星々さえ	<br>
Even the stars in the night sky<br>
君に嫉妬するだろう	<br>
Would be jealous of you.<br>
遣り切れずため息をつくだろう<br>	
Unable to bear it, they can’t help but let a sigh out.<br>
瞳は僕を捉え	<br>
Your eyes are focusing on me<br>
確かにそこにいるのに	<br>
And I certainly am there—<br>
映すのに	<br>
I should be reflected there,<br>
どこか虚ろに空を見る	<br>
But you look into space, somewhat vacantly.<br>

少しだけ絡めた指先	<br>
I intertwined my fingers with yours just a little<br>
酷く冷えていた	<br>
And found them awfully cold.<br>
「ここが苦しいの」と笑った君は	<br>
“I feel so much pain in here,” you laughed<br>
数秒で手を離してしまう	<br>
And let go of my hand in only a few seconds.<br>
伝えたい言葉は鋭利	<br>
The words I want to convey are so sharp.<br>
それでも僕は	<br>
But since I, nevertheless,<br>
こんな人間だ	<br>
Am a person like this,<br>
証明をここに残す	<br>
I will just leave my proof here—<br>
「愛している、君だけを。」	<br>
“I love you, you only.”<br>

深い眠りの奥いつか	<br>
In the depths of a sound sleep, I will<br>
鼓動を確かめて	<br>
Someday ascertain if my heart’s pulsating—<br>
全て夢だった	<br>
Everything was just a dream.<br>
そして混沌は	<br>
And the chaos<br>
また花開く、と歩き出す	<br>
Will set off on foot, foretelling another efflorescence.<br>
眩んだ視界の先十のうち	<br>
Beyond my faint sight, out of ten,<br>
君はもう遠く	<br>
You’ve already gone quite far away,<br>
薄い透明のベールをひらり纏い	<br>
Clad in a thin, transparent veil,<br>
闇を飾っていく	<br>
Decorating the darkness.

"It was early morning, the day was snowy." <br>
「注がれる眼差しを」	<br>
"The gaze focused solely on me,"<br>
「とても、とてもよく覚えています」	<br>
"I remember it very, very well." <br>
「光のようだ、と言うのでしょうか」	<br>
"Would you say that it's like the light?"<br>
「あれから──年」	<br>
"Since then, it has been ── years,"<br>
「本当に色々ありましたね」	<br>
"Honestly, so much stuff has happened,"<br>
「あなた方の音に、詞に、想いに」	<br>
"And your sounds, your words, your feelings," <br>
「僕も救われています」	<br>
"I am saved by them as well."<br>

諦めない願いは空に還り	<br>
The wish I didn't give up on returns to the sky,<br>
0を超え世界を駆けて	<br>
It exceeds 0 and runs around the world.<br>
いつもあなたの傍で照らす光あれ	<br>
Let there be light that always shines besides you,<br>
未知を拓く雷鳴の様に	<br>
As if the sound you made that can go anywhere<br>
どこまでも征けるあなたの音を	<br>
Is the thunder that clears the unknown path.<br>

唯 愛していました	<br>
I simply loved it,<br>
重ねた日々は遠く 未だ 青く<br>	
The piled up days are still far away and blue.<br>

もしも 心が在るのなら あなたに歌を書いて	<br>
If I have a heart, would I be able to write a song for you,<br>
この一瞬を切り取って 永久に残せるかな	<br>
To snip off this moment and leave it behind permanently?<br>
鏡越し託された証明よ	<br>
O, proof entrusted to me from beyond the mirror,<br>
飽くなき喜びに涙を	<br>
Give tears to that everlasting joy,<br>
果てなき悲しみに深い眠りを	<br>
And a deep slumber to that endless sorrow.<br>

書き切れない想いは海を巡り	<br>
The thoughts that I couldn't completely write down return to the sea,<br>
1を変え世界に融けて	<br>
It alters 1 and melts into the world.<br>
いつかあなたの傍に描く未来あれと	<br>
May the future I imagine by your side someday come to be.<br>

過去も今も明日も愛しくて	<br>
I adore the past, the present and tomorrow,<br>
エゴもイドも命も等しくて	<br>
As well as my ego, my id, and my life equally.<br>
総てが僕たちだけの始音で 祷りで	<br>
Everything is just our starting sounds and hopes,<br>
初めての音を憶えていますか	<br>
So, do you remember your very first sound?<br>
これからも聴いてくれますか	<br>
Will you still listen to me after this?<br>
僕の生きた証を ずっと<br>
To the proof that I was alive, forever.
