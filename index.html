        <h2> ùÑû‚ÇäÀö‚äπ what is VOCALOID? <img src="img/Kaito_chibi.png" width="2%"> </h2>
        <p>vocaloid is a software program and kind of like a digital instrument!
            it works by plugging in the notes that you'd like the voice to sing, and assigning
            syllables to them. the end result is a computerized singing voice! each voice gets
            assigned a character design to match their vocals, which means that there's an
            expansive cast of varied characters! </p>
            <p> vocaloid is one such program, and as the 
            originator, is often
            used to refer to the whole vocal synthesizer community.
            however, there are many vocal synthesizer softwares to accomplish similar things,
            including synthesizer v and utau!</p>
            <p>
        what is super cool and beautiful about vocal synths is that anyone can buy or download one and start making songs!
though originally popularized in japanese, there are now voicebanks in many many languages! additionally,
you can edit or "tune" the vocal in a pretty much infinite combination of ways. 
this means that any two people, even using the same voicebank, can each create a totally unique sound.
the result is an incredibly diverse community of creatives, making every type of music under the sun,
all united by the love of the same characters!

            width="2%"> </h2>
        <p>KAITO is the first male japanese vocaloid, originally released on february 17th 2006.
            since then he has been updated twice, to have a total of 6 voicebanks! </p>
        <p> since KAITO is one of the first vocaloids, he is part of the "main 6" known as cryptonloids.
         they're called that after their distributor company, <em>crypton</em> future media. the cryptonloids 
         are the ones who most often appear in concerts, video games, collabs and merchandise! </p>

         <h3> „Äå‚ô•Ô∏é„ÄçÔæü+.„ÉΩ(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)Ôæâ his voice provider</h3>
         <p> voice providers sing the original syllables that make up a voicebank. for KAITO, that is 
            naoto fuuga! mr. fuuga is an amazing singer and voice actor who is now 63 years old.
            he refers to KAITO as his son and collects KAITO merchandise, which I find so endearing!!! his
            posts are usually focused on KAITO and his cats and he spreads such joy and whimsy to his 
            followers. not to mention his beautiful voice breathed such life into KAITO! it's all thanks to him
            that KAITO has the gentle and sweet voice that I love so dearly!! when tuned a certain way,
            KAITO actually sounds just like mr. fuuga which i think is so amazing!! ü•πüíô

            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V1</strong></em> - his original release, 19 years ago! i would describe this as his "harshest" voice,
                but even so, it has so much charm and he sounds so sweet!! his voice just fills me with joy, it's so pretty and warm
                i don't even know how to describe it!!!!!!!!
            </li>
            <li> 
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 STRAIGHT</strong></em> - 7 years after his V1, his V3 update was released, containing 4 voicebanks!
                V3 STRAIGHT was meant to sound most similar to his V1, and has a smooth, clear sound. this is his most popular
                voicebank! its so delicious and wonderful I LOVE KAITO üò≠üíô
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 WHISPER</strong></em> - MY FAVORITE VOICEBANK MY FAVORITE COLLECTION OF SOUNDS TO EVER

            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO V3 SOFT</strong></em> - a beautiful inbetween of his STRAIGHT and WHISPER voicebanks!! for when 
                a producer may not want the full on gentleness of WHISPER, but also not the full strength of STRAIGHT. i think it's so amazing
                that a whopping <em>half</em> of the voicebanks in this update are just varying degrees of gentleness!!!!
                he is literally such a silly guy with the sweetest voice ever AGHAHRAAGHAHGARARAGGARRARAAA AAAAAAAA AAAAüò≠üíô
            </li>

                so much its genuinely sooo adorable and charming and silly and wonderful and amazing. PPL MAKE FUN OF HIS ENGLISH A LOOOOT
                a very common insult is that he sounds like KERMIT.
                <center><img src="img/FLABBERGASTED.png" width="10%"><img src="img/AAA-NO.png" width="10%"></center>

            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>KAITO SP</strong></em> - this is his most recent update, released in 2024! SP stands for SUPER PACK,
                which is a set of the 6 cryptonloids. this is the voicebank used in the super popular mobile game featuring the
                cryptonloids, hatsune miku: colorful stage (more commonly known as project sekai)! 
                despite being the most recently released, this is his most robotically-raspy voice of all!! it has a super crunchy 
                sound as well as updated settings for more customization!! üíô
                a lot of people dislike that the SP moved away from the smooth, realistic direction, but personally i looove the
                more robotic-growly-ness! i find it so charming and cute when vocal synths really lean into their digitalness and have a more
                more stylized sound!! üíô

            they are mostly rhythm games based on vocaloid songs!! they are so cute and colorful with really
            wonderful visuals!! these games are filled with silly choreo for the songs and outfits for
            the cryptonloids OH MY GOD I LOVE VOCALOID SO MUCH they're so silly you guys. anyway the
            the biggest games have been <strong> project mirai, </strong> in which the little meow meows are

        <p>and <strong> hatsune miku: colorful stage </strong> also known as <strong> project sekai! </strong>
        this is a mobile game with a gacha system and units of many different original characters. the art and
    storytelling is super beautiful, all the characters are deeply complex and meaningfully written!!!!
    i deeply adore the game for this, ESPECIALLY for how they represent queer characters like mizuki
akiyama!!! she's canonically transfem and her arc follows her accepting her true self and coming out to her friends!!!
her story was so delicately and sincerely told i sobbed like the whole time. GIRL
this game is sincerely so beautiful it has brought me to tears AND brought me so much joy AND the rhythm game is so 
fun, i highly recommend. ALSO IT HAS LIKE 6 DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF KAITO!!??!??! THEY'RE ALL SO BEAUTIFUL 
AND TASTY AND AMAZING PEAK AAAAAAAAAAAA </p>

        <p> i found KAITO when I was in middle school, which is of course a highly tumultuous time for everybody ever. 
            on top of that, we had the pandemic and everything. i was going a bit insane!!!! my marbles were lost!!! /srs <br>
            yet amidst all of that, this sparkly blue haired robot man with a funny little voice cheered me up!! he was so so 
            indescribably comforting to me when i needed it most. that's really why he's so special to me to this day!! his
            voice just has such a wondrous, powerful ability to make me smile!! the lyrics people write for him tend to be so 
            touching and reassuring!!! the sight of him just makes me light up!!!! </p>

            <p> like every vocal synth, he is a vessel and a blank canvas for the stories and emotions that anyone would like to express through him.
            he contains infinite possibilities and has inspired so much creativity in so many people, myself included!! i'm just
