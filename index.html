        <h2> 𝄞₊˚⊹ what is VOCALOID? </h2>
        <p>vocaloid is a software program and kind of like a digital instrument!
            it works by plugging in the notes that you'd like the voice to sing, and assigning
            syllables to them. the end result is a computerized singing voice! each voice gets
            assigned a character design to match their vocals, which means that there's an
            expansive cast of varied characters! </p>
            <p> vocaloid is one such program, and as the 
            originator, is often
            used to refer to the whole vocal synthesizer community.
            however, there are many vocal synthesizer softwares to accomplish similar things,
            including synthesizer v and utau!</p>
            <p>
        what is super cool and beautiful about vocal synths is that anyone can buy or download one and start making songs!
though originally popularized in japanese, there are now voicebanks in many many languages! additionally,
you can edit or "tune" the vocal in a pretty much infinite combination of ways. 
this means that any two people, even using the same voicebank, can each create a totally unique sound.
the result is an incredibly diverse community of creatives, making every type of music under the sun,
all united by the love of the same characters!
</p>

        <h2> ‧₊˚♪ who is KAITO?</h2>
        <p>KAITO is the first male japanese vocaloid, originally released on february 17th 2006.
            since then he has been updated twice, to have a total of 6 voicebanks! </p>

            </p>
        <p> since KAITO is one of the first vocaloids, he is part of the "main 6" known as cryptonloids.
         they're called that after the company in charge of them, <em>crypton</em> future media. the cryptonloids 
         are the ones who most often appear in concerts, video games, collabs and merchandise! </p>

         <h3> 「♥︎」ﾟ+.ヽ(≧▽≦)ﾉ his voice provider</h3>
         <p> voice providers sing the original syllables that make up a voicebank. for KAITO, that is 
            naoto fuuga! mr. fuuga is an amazing singer and voice actor who is now 63 years old.
            he refers to KAITO as his son and collects KAITO merchandise, which I find so endearing!!! his
            posts are usually focused on KAITO and his cats and he spreads such joy and whimsy to his 
            followers. not to mention his beautiful voice breathed such life into KAITO! it's all thanks to him
            that KAITO has the gentle and sweet voice that I love so dearly!! when tuned a certain way,
            KAITO actually sounds just like mr. fuuga which i think is so amazing!! 🥹💙

        <p id="garnet-lyrics"> 青く澄んだ雨の病	<br>
Disease of a clear-blue rain. <br>
一人きりの呼吸は徒然	<br>
All alone, I breathe leisurely.<br>
痛む心に滲む鋼鉄の愛があった	<br>
Within my sore heart was this steel love spreading.<br>

触れたならば消えてしまう	<br>
“Just like a dimly burning flame<br>
微かに灯る炎のように	<br>
That would die out when touched,<br>
全てを知らないままでいたいと君は言う	<br>
I wish to be ignorant of everything,” you say.<br>

透けた白い首筋に	<br>
Onto your white, almost-transparent neck,<br>
控えめに下がるGarnet	<br>
A drop of garnet falls down modestly.<br>
閉じた目蓋に艶めくアイシャドウ	<br>
Upon your closed eyelids, the eye shadow glitters.<br>
羽のようにふわりと舞う体が	<br>
Your body, fluttering like a feather, <br>
時に震えて凍えて	<br>
Trembles and shivers at times, <br>
溢れた涙は冷たい	<br>
And the tears you spilled are so cold.<br>

甘い想いと憂いの恋は	<br>
That sweet feeling and sorrowful love<br>
幻のようで	<br>
Were like illusions—<br>
「どこにも行かないで」	<br>
“Please don’t go anywhere.”<br>
なんて言葉すり抜けてく	<br>
Words like that are slipping through me.<br>
身勝手な夢	<br>
What a selfish dream!<br>
歪んだ瞳の奥見せた赤い光が	<br>
The red light you showed me, which resided in your distorted eyes,<br>
記憶の深くに巣食って	<br>
Haunted me deep within my memory,<br>
煌めいては僕を突き放す	<br>
And when it glitters, I feel forsaken.<br>

挽歌の海沈んだなら	<br>
If we sank into the sea of elegy,<br>
静寂の悲愴を愛せただろう	<br>
We could love the grief of silence—<br>
そんな話ばかりを僕らは好んでた	<br>
We’ve always liked that kind of talk.<br>

夜空の星々さえ	<br>
Even the stars in the night sky<br>
君に嫉妬するだろう	<br>
Would be jealous of you.<br>
遣り切れずため息をつくだろう<br>	
Unable to bear it, they can’t help but let a sigh out.<br>
瞳は僕を捉え	<br>
Your eyes are focusing on me<br>
確かにそこにいるのに	<br>
And I certainly am there—<br>
映すのに	<br>
I should be reflected there,<br>
どこか虚ろに空を見る	<br>
But you look into space, somewhat vacantly.<br>

少しだけ絡めた指先	<br>
I intertwined my fingers with yours just a little<br>
酷く冷えていた	<br>
And found them awfully cold.<br>
「ここが苦しいの」と笑った君は	<br>
“I feel so much pain in here,” you laughed<br>
数秒で手を離してしまう	<br>
And let go of my hand in only a few seconds.<br>
伝えたい言葉は鋭利	<br>
The words I want to convey are so sharp.<br>
それでも僕は	<br>
But since I, nevertheless,<br>
こんな人間だ	<br>
Am a person like this,<br>
証明をここに残す	<br>
I will just leave my proof here—<br>
「愛している、君だけを。」	<br>
“I love you, you only.”<br>

深い眠りの奥いつか	<br>
In the depths of a sound sleep, I will<br>
鼓動を確かめて	<br>
Someday ascertain if my heart’s pulsating—<br>
全て夢だった	<br>
Everything was just a dream.<br>
そして混沌は	<br>
And the chaos<br>
また花開く、と歩き出す	<br>
Will set off on foot, foretelling another efflorescence.<br>
眩んだ視界の先十のうち	<br>
Beyond my faint sight, out of ten,<br>
君はもう遠く	<br>
You’ve already gone quite far away,<br>
薄い透明のベールをひらり纏い	<br>
Clad in a thin, transparent veil,<br>
闇を飾っていく	<br>
Decorating the darkness.
